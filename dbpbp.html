<div class="aboutdbody">There was a terrible plane crash in Japan and a police detective named Hamasaki was assigned to investigate the cause of the accident. There was only one survivor, a thirteen-year old girl named Takayo-chan. She had been badly injured in the crash and was in a coma. For a long time, the doctors didn’t think she would ever recover. However, within a few days, she had miraculously regained consciousness. She was still very weak and unable to speak. The doctors made it possible for her to communicate electronically. They attached electrodes to her back teeth. Whenever she gnashed her teeth, and the electrodes touched, a beeper would sound. The detective needed to ask her some questions so he arranged a simple code with her to communicate. Two beeps meant “Yes” and one beep meant “No”. Takayo-chan was still in a very fragile state and the doctors didn’t want her getting too excited. For this reason, the detective was the only person allowed in the room with her. He was not allowed to record her on video camera, but they did allow him to use an audio tape recorder. The following is a transcript of their recorded conversation: “Good morning, Takayo-chan…” (Silence) “I am Detective Hamasaki. Are you feeling well enough to talk to me?” BEEP BEEP “I need to ask you some questions about the accident.” BEEP BEEP “When the plane was taking off, did you notice anything unusual?” BEEP “The other passengers were normal?” BEEP BEEP “Something happened while the plane was in flight, though.” BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP “Does that mean YES?” BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP “I’m sorry, I know this is painful for you. Do you want to stop for a moment?” BEEP “OK. So we can continue?” BEEP BEEP “Before the accident, did the plane shake at all?” BEEP BEEP “Did you notice anything else unusual?” BEEP BEEP “Was there something that scared you?” BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP “What’s wrong?” BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP “You’re trembling. Takayo-chan, calm down… I know, I know… Something scared you very badly. Take a moment. Relax. We’ll continue, OK?” BEEP BEEP “Did the engine sound strange?” BEEP “Did you hear an explosion or something?” BEEP “Did you see something through the window?” BEEP BEEP “Did you see something hit the plane?” BEEP “What did you see from your window?” BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP “Takayo-chan, are you afraid? It’s alright now, you don’t need to be scared. You’re safe here. You’re in the hospital. No harm can come to you here.” BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP “Come on, calm down. Are you OK now? Do you want to continue?” BEEP BEEP “What could you have seen in the window? Was it another aircraft?” BEEP “Was there something wrong with the wing of the plane?” BEEP BEEP “Was the wing broken?” BEEP BEEP “Something fell off the wing?” BEEP “Something broke the wing?” BEEP BEEP “Was anything else broken?” BEEP BEEP “The window?” BEEP BEEP “Something broke the window?” BEEP BEEP “Something came through the window?” BEEP BEEP “That something… Was that what caused the terrible wounds to the other passengers?” BEEP BEEP “The scratches all over your body, Takayo chan… They were caused by this something?” BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP “We found saliva in the wounds… This something had a mouth?” BEEP BEEP “With fangs? Sharp teeth?” BEEP BEEP “Was it hairy?” BEEP BEEP “With eyes too?” BEEP BEEP “Did it have arms and legs?” BEEP BEEP “And it was small? Smaller than a child?” BEEP BEEP “The other passengers… Their internal organs were missing… They were devoured from the inside by this something?” BEEP BEEP “How did it get into their bodies? Through a hole?” BEEP BEEP “This something… It chewed a hole through the stomach?” BEEP “No? It went through the mouth?” BEEP BEEP “And when it came out again… That was when it chewed through the stomach?” BEEP BEEP “You watched as it devoured the others?” BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP “Your parents too?” BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP “And it caused the deep scratches all over your body?” BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP “It ate all the others, but you… It left you alive?” (Silence) “Why, Takayo-chan? Why did it spare your life?” (Silence) “Takayo-chan? Are you OK? You look pale. Can you hear me?” (Silence) “What’s the matter with you, Takayo-chan? What’s wrong? (Silence) “Are you alright? You don’t look very well.” (Silence) “Are you bleeding? Is that blood? Takayo-chan, you’re bleeding.” (Silence) “Oh my God! Oh God No! Help! Help me! Help!…” This is where the recording ends. All that could be heard on the rest of the tape were the screams of Detective H and the sound of gurgling, scraping, cracking and munching. Twenty minutes later, a nurse came into the hospital room and found a horrific scene. The walls were splattered with blood and the half-eaten corpse of Detective Hamasaki lay on the floor. The thirteen-year old girl known as Takayo-chan was lying in her bed. There was a hole in her stomach and all of her internal organs had been removed. There was no trace of them. This recording is the only clue police have in the mysterious murder of Detective Hamasaki and Takayo-chan. The government went to a great deal of trouble to hush all of this up. The exact details of what occurred on the plane and in that hospital room remain shrouded in mystery.
