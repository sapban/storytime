<br><h1><u>An Island Where Feelings Lived</u></h1>
<div class="aboutbody">Once there was a island where all feelings lived: Happiness, Sadness, Knowledge, including Love. One day they got to know that the island was going to sank, So all constructed boats and left except Love. Love was the only one who stayed because it wanted to hold out until the last moment. When the island almost sank Love decided to ask for help. Richness was passing by in grand boat. Love saw and asked “Richness, can you take me with you?” Richness Replied, “There is no place for you as i already have lots of gold and silver to take with me.” The love saw vanity passing by and asked, “Please help me.” Vanity answered, “I can’t help you as you are all wet and might damage my boat.” Now love saw sadness and asked it, “Take me with you.” Sadness refused saying, “Love I am already so sad that i need to be with myself only. Similarly all other feelings passed by and all refused to take love with them. Suddenly Love heard a voice, “Come Love, I will take you.” It was an elder (Knowledge). When they arrived at a dry land, after leaving Love elder went away. Realizing how much he owed elder, Love asked him, “Who helped me?” “It was Time.” Elder replied. Love asked again, “Why did Time helped me?” Knowledge smiled with deep Wisdom and answered, “Because only Time is capable of understanding how valuable Love is.”
