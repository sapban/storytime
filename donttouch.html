<br><h1><u>Sir Dont Touch Me Again</u></h1>

<div class="aboutbody">A taxi passenger tapped the driver on the shoulder to ask him a question. The driver shouts aloud, Car gets out of control and nearly hit a bus, went up on the footpath, and stopped inches away from a shop window.

For a second there was complete silence in the cab, then the driver said, “Sir, don’t you ever do that again. You nearly killed me!”

The passenger apologized for his tap and said, “Sorry, I didn’t know that a little tap would scare you so much. ” The cab driver replied, “No Sir, It’s not you.

Actually, Today is my first day as a cab driver – I used to drive a funeral van for the last 25 years and no one tapped.
