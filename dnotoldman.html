<br><h1><u>A Not So Nice Old Man </u></h1>
<div class="aboutdbody">A boy was riding a cycle with a basket of eggs on it. He hit a stone and fell down alongside the cycle. The eggs also fell and broke. A crowd gathered around the boy. As usual, free advice and taunts started flowing from the onlookers “Couldn’t you be more careful?” “What were you thinking, cycling, casually without attention?” An old man approached the crowd saw what had happened and aforesaid “Poor fellow, now, what will he answer to his Owner about the eggs. Ok, I am going to help him, as maximum amount as I can”…… saying this handed over $ 10/- to the boy. And mentioned, “These onlookers are good people, they will not only give advice, but they will help you by giving money also, accept their help”. The onlookers observing the sayings of the old man and his actions gave money to the boy. The boy was very happy since the money collected was over the worth of the eggs broken. One of the onlookers asked the boy “Young man if that old man wasn’t around, I do not know what difficulties you would have faced with your owner” The boy looked at the man and said, “Sir, He is the owner of the shop, where I work”.
