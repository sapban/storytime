<br><h1><u>I'll Fly Away</u></h1>
<div class="aboutbody">The professor said, “Mr. Anand, you do not understand. A pig and a bird don’t sit along to eat.” Anand looked at him and calmly replied, “You do not worry professor. I’ll fly away,” and he gets up and sat at another table. Mr. Peters, reddened with anger, decided to take revenge. The next day at school he asked the following question: “Mr. Anand if you were walking down the street and found a package, and within was a bag of wisdom and another bag with money, which one would you take ?” Without hesitating, Anand responded, “The one with the money, of course.” Mr. Peters, smiles and said, “I, in your place, would have taken the wisdom.” Anand shrugged and responded, “Each one takes what he doesn’t have.” Mr. Peters, by now, was fit to be tied. So great was his anger that he wrote on Anand’s exam sheet the word “idiot” and gave it to him. Anand took the exam sheet and sat down at his desk trying very hard to remain calm while he contemplated his next move. A few minutes later, Anand got up, went to the professor and told him in a dignified polite tone, “Mr. Peters, you signed the sheet, but you probably didn’t give me the grade.” Peters shocked, Anand rocked.
