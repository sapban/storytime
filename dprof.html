<br><h1><u>Professor Shanku and the Macaw</u></h1>
<div class="aboutdbody">It was 7th June Sunday morning when Professor Gajanan Talukdar visited Professor T. Shanku and having conversation in Shanku's balcony . Professor Tarafdar is an unscrupulous scientist who loves to snoop in on other scientists' works and to profit from their work. He harrases Shonku with his direct questions and his behaviour irritates Shonku.

While Shonku was busy with his experiment to create an invisibility potion, Tarafdar arrives to meet with him. Tarafdar's interrogation and his minute examination of Shonku's every single thing distresses Shonku. When Shonku gets distracted with a mail which came in his name, Tarafdar starts reading Shonku's notebook which contains his experiments and formulae. Shonku arrives, sees him doing that and cleverly gets rid of him from his house. Even after that, Tarafdar arrives at his house, but Shonku keeps him away from his laboratory, thus dissuading him from reading Shonku's notes.

Later, Tarafdar goes to Hazaribagh, from where he writes a letter to Shonku, challenging him by saying that he'll make an invisibility potion before him in order to defeat him. Tarafdar's challenge and his way of writing distresses Shonku.

One morning, after returning from a morning walk, Shonku discovers a macaw bird sitting on the branch of his garden's tree. Albeit shocked at first, Shonku keeps the macaw with himself.

While experimenting with his invisibility potion one day, Shonku attempts to test the potion on a guinea pig when, to his utter shock, the macaw starts speaking to him in clear Bengali language and asks what he's doing. Shonku briefly explains his work to the macaw and when the bird asks about the potion in his hand, Shonku explains what it is and even reveals the formula of the potion. The macaw turns silent when Shonku asks how it learnt Bengali.

Later one night, while returning to his bedroom after having dinner, Shonku hears the macaw murmuring the invisibility potion's formula to itself. Both of them say good night to each other and leave.

One day later, the macaw vanishes from Shonku's house. While entering in his laboratory, Shonku discovers the laboratory window open and the macaw gone. Albeit sad at the macaw's departure, he becomes suspicious about the open window as he clearly remembers that he closed it. In order to get over the sadness, Shonku focuses on his work.

The next month, after Shonku has finished his experiment, an incident happens in his house. After returning from his prolonged morning walk, he sees the main door open and the lock broken and his pet cat Newton afraid. Hearing sounds coming from his laboratory, Shonku rushes inside and sees that his laboratory has been ransacked in his absence and, most importantly, he sees a bundle of his notebooks flying in the air on their own and going towards the open window. Shonku pounces upon his notebooks and a struggle ensues between him and an invisible person. Shonku succeeds in overpowering the invisible intruder and retrieving his notes, but the invisible intruder tries to escape. Another invisible creature arrives and attacks the escaping invisible intruder. With the help of their voices, Shonku recognizes both the invisible creatures: the person whom he overpowered is the invisible Tarafdar and Tarafdar's invisible attacker is the macaw. Tarafdar, though wounded by the macaw, manages to escape and the macaw arrives at Shonku's house.

The macaw now reveals the entire truth to Shonku: the macaw was actually the part of a Brazilian circus. Tarafdar went to Brazil a few years ago and stole the macaw from there. The macaw, who was already intelligent and proficient in several languages, started living with Tarafdar and learnt Bengali language from him. Tarafdar, eager to defeat Shonku in the challenge, sent the macaw to infiltrate Shonku's household and to gather the invisibility potion's formula. Tarafdar created his potion after hearing the formula from the macaw and successfully became invisible. Thinking that the macaw can betray him in the future, Tarafdar tries to kill the bird, in order to silence the bird forever and also to suppress his dirty secrets which the bird knows. Seeing the invisible Tarafdar pulling out his gun, the visibly afraid macaw drank Tarafdar's invisibility potion to save itself. Missing his chance to kill the bird, Tarafdar leaves Hazaribagh and arrives in Giridih to steal Shonku's notebooks; unbeknownst to him, the macaw followed him.

The story ends with Shonku thanking the now-visible macaw, and the macaw thanking Shonku in return.
